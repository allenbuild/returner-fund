# Scoring Diagnostics v4 Audit

- Frozen clock: `2026-07-17T12:00:00.000Z`
- Production model: `returner-traction-v4-bounded-primary-signal-calibrated` (`returner-traction` v4.3.1)
- Git SHA: excluded from deterministic artifacts; the runtime command logs the executing revision.
- Input envelope SHA-256: `eb4d3dc0b09d47fd16ccd8e3a0f820476b6d13965ac81c6d201120e114a3d499`
- Effective versioned scoring-input SHA-256: `4c8276c3c4efc5f1037fd9d2b499bc04728d934abe59e32ab62d809e618f5a7c`
- Canonical config: 69 leaf parameters across scoring, calibration, and confidence; 9 role-labeled runtime source files.
- Audit JSON SHA-256: `56ec5fb05a40e5bf5736a4680709f001e4ccf3ae8ee934cbf9f7a53fc080050b`
- Detail retention: at most 32 examples per repetitive collection; 103578 repeated records omitted across 128 collections with full SHA-256 commitments.
- Release size ceiling: 50331648 bytes.
- Command: `npm run scoring:audit:v4`
- Direct command: `node --experimental-strip-types --loader ./scripts/lib/scoring-diagnostics-ts-loader.mjs ./scripts/run-scoring-diagnostics-v4.mjs`
- Safety: local snapshots only; `fetch` disabled; no API calls, benchmark writes, source edits, or user-data mutation.
- Compatibility shims: none.

## Executive summary

- 490 companies across 3 cohorts were inspected with 47393 cohort-scoped evidence rows.
- Global canonical duplicates: 1 company-ID groups, 1 founder-ID groups, 5 social-account URL groups, 0 physical-post groups, and 810 evidence URL groups.
- Alias diagnostics found 560 overlaps across 456 scored rows.
- Production eligibility rejected 31376 rows, including 0 rows whose incoming contribution flag was positive.
- URL diagnostics found 0 scored profile/search/non-native rows. Publication-date metadata gaps affect 700 scored rows; metric gaps affect 0.
- Robust fences flagged 612 eligible evidence rows and 29/29 company scores before/after.
- Monotonicity produced 0 failing company tests. Cleanup changed ranks in 0/3 cohorts and scores in 0/27 batch/platform slices; maximum overall/platform rank shifts were 0/0.
- Invariants: 14/14 passed. Any violation exits nonzero before artifact writes.

The after view is a diagnostic simulation only. It does not update the production model, graph, benchmarks, snapshots, or stored scores.

## Interpretation notes

- GitHub `watchers_count` is stored as `watchers` by the local collector and commonly equals stars. v4 flags equal positive star/watcher pairs; the diagnostic after view canonicalizes metrics with the production normalizer.
- URL findings distinguish platform profiles, search/result pages, and URLs rejected by the production native-evidence check. Zero-score context rows are still counted in diagnostics but do not create a score delta.
- Eligibility rejections use the exported production `scoringEligibility` predicate. The after view removes rejected rows but retains publication-date gaps that production handles with conservative momentum.
- Physical-post duplicates use the production `canonicalPostKey` and `dedupeEvidenceForScoring` comparator only when every retained candidate is eligible and maps to one unambiguous company owner. Ambiguous ownership is reported and never silently collapsed.
- Evidence outliers use Tukey 1.5 IQR fences over `log1p` production-weighted raw engagement; company score outliers use direct 0-100 scores. These are inventory flags, not invariant failures or automatic exclusions.
- Monotonicity uses a deterministic raw-engagement-stratified sample capped at 40 scored rows per platform; exact eligible, sampled, and coverage counts are recorded per cohort in the JSON audit.
- Published scores can include cohort calibration in dataset builders. The before/after comparison therefore uses a fresh exported-scorer baseline on both sides; published ranks remain a separate reference.
- The JSON audit includes every config leaf hash, role-labeled effective source hash, all aggregate findings and invariant observations, and deterministic bounded examples for repetitive row-level collections. Each omitted collection retains its full record count and SHA-256 commitment in `metadata.detail_retention.collections`.
- The full machine-readable artifact is `docs/outputs/scoring-diagnostics-v4-audit.json`.

The profiler writes only the two allowlisted files under `docs/outputs/` and performs no network or mutable API calls.
